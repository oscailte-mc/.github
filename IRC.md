# Community IRC

We are on [Esper.net](https://esper.net)!

The following channels are in use:
| Channel                   | Usage                                        | Discord Equivalent   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| #oscailte                 | General Oscailte Discussion                  | #general             |
| #oscailte-discipline      | General Discipline Discussion                | #discipline          |
| #oscailte-discipline-dev  | Discipline Development Discussion[^1]        | #discipline-dev      |

All of these channels are bridged with our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/EMNG9X3ZDQ)

[^1]: This is a less formal version of the discussion board, for hashing out ideas in a less asyncroneous form, for ideas or discussions that will lead to further
development / implementation, these should be moved onto Github for all users to see, not just those on Discord or IRC.
